Cedar (the **Computational Environment for Dynamics of Advanced Reactors**) is a
high-fidelity, transient multiphysics code developed for the analysis of
advanced nuclear reactor systems. It is designed to model the tightly coupled
physics governing transient reactor behavior such as neutron transport, thermal
hydraulics, and system power balance. Cedar is written entirely in Python, which
makes it both easy to use and flexible to extend with new physics models.
